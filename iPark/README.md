# iPark
A web application titled iPark for CS411 Group 3.
Software developed for searching and renting available private parking spaces in crowded area, it also provide a great opportunity for space owner to rent their private spaces out when they are not in use. 

Project Summary
iPark project covers user authentication(e-mail validation) and management(register, login), searching and renting available spaces in flow(search-rent-payment). Up to now it supports renters search and book spaces that in the database, as well as space owners to register their spaces. 
In the future, we may want to add more functionality such as space validation (i.e. make sure that the space owner register a real private space), review and rate system to share users’ experience, a reservation system for renters to book spaces in advance and a haggling system for renters and space owners to contact with each other.
